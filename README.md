Economic Slowdown Early Warning System using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

The Economic Slowdown Early Warning System is a machine learning–based project designed to identify early signals of economic slowdown using key macroeconomic indicators.
The goal of this system is to assist policymakers, analysts, and researchers in understanding potential economic risks before a slowdown becomes severe.

Objectives

- Analyze historical macroeconomic indicators

- Capture trend and lag effects in economic data
